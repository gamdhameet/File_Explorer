# My First Project on Rust

This is my first project using the Rust programming language! I built a comprehensive, professional-grade file explorer application that runs on your computer. The app provides a complete file management experience with a modern graphical interface, built-in terminal, and powerful features. You can browse folders, manage files with full copy/cut/paste operations, use keyboard shortcuts, customize the interface with different themes and view modes, save bookmarks, and much more. It's like having a feature-rich file manager with an integrated terminal, built entirely from scratch using Rust and the eframe GUI library.

## üöÄ Core Features

### **File Operations**
- **Right-click context menu** with Copy, Cut, Paste, Delete, Rename, Properties
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Ctrl+C (copy), Ctrl+X (cut), Ctrl+V (paste), Del (delete), F2 (rename)
- **Create new files and folders** with dedicated buttons
- **File properties dialog** showing size, permissions, and modification date
- **Multi-file selection** with Ctrl+click
- **Open files** by clicking (uses system's default application)

### **Enhanced Navigation**
- **Breadcrumb navigation** - clickable path components in the top bar
- **Back/Forward buttons** with full navigation history
- **Bookmarks/Favorites** - save and quickly access frequently used directories

2. Use Back/Forward buttons to navigate through history
3. Add bookmarks for frequently accessed directories
4. Use terminal `cd` commands to navigate programmatically

### **Terminal**
1. Type commands in the terminal at the bottom
2. Use `cd` to change directories (updates file explorer)
